                    I am not a psychologist, but like you, who are 
                    readding this, I have also had tough seasons 
                    in my life, just like everyone in this planet. 
                    Seasons and incidents that made me feel low, 
                    like proffesionally unexperienced, almost a child 
                    compared to other's talent and skills, I have 
                    also been rejected in many jobs I felt so 
                    enthusiastic about, I have also failed many 
                    some university subjects though time and many 
                    failures more in my life. I have felt 
                    like just giving up. 
                    But I also have learned that throwing 
                    everything away is never the solution. 
                    It is an answer, yes, but it is not the 
                    correct one. The following words are the 
                    reflection of my personal thoughts after 
                    years and years of educational and professional 
                    efforts in my country (Mexico), and even here 
                    in Canada so far.

                <p class="essay_Content">
                    We are living tough times, inflation, wars, debts, unemployment and 
                    insecurity in many countries, pollution, and many more situations 
                    that each one of us must deal with every day. We start doubting on 
                    ourselves when desperation and stress eat us alive, most of times 
                    we just feel like quit and get away from these difficult situations 
                    without looking back ever again.  
                    The world is full of negative situations, but it is just us who decide 
                    how to react to these situations. We are human beings, it is in our 
                    nature to fail, to self-doubting, to decrease our hopes, to question 
                    why things happened that way and to us. The world has made us believe 
                    that we must not make mistakes in professional and sometimes educational 
                    fields to achieve a well-positioned jobs and to place national and 
                    international companies in the top against competitors. However, 
                    even the toughest situations have a solution, and that is our minds, 
                    our self-respect, self-love. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="essay_Content">
                    Happiness is a decision. We feel low, sadness and even paranoia when 
                    facing difficult situations, but we are not alone. We have our family, 
                    our friends to encourage us to keep going, we have to each other. 
                    Life is made of challenges and we all shall know that we came to this 
                    world not to overcome others but overcome ourselves. By challenging 
                    ourselves we grow as persons make us more grateful beings, and that is 
                    what our parents teach us since childhood, but we start forgetting while 
                    growing up. 
                    When we find what we really love to do, we star enjoying life. 
                    Life begins when we stop considering other people's negative opinions 
                    and learning from our mistakes to start again now from experience. 
                    When we accept that mistakes are not bad things our mindsets strengthen 
                    and give us the courage to face difficulties with a smile and do whatever 
                    you once thought you could not. There will be many moments in which we are 
                    going to feel low and defeated again, but if you could rise your head once 
                    before, you can do it any other time in the future no matter the edge, no 
                    matter the situation, no matter the cost.

                    Success is when you overcome difficulties by knowing you never gave up 
                    when that was exactly what you wanted the most during that process. 
                    If you fail, that is all right as long as you keep trying again and 
                    again after feeling defeated and keep trying until you make it. After 
                    all, Â¿have you thought on how boring the life would be if everything was 
                    easy for everyone all the time?
