               Located in Yucatan, MÃ©xico, Chichen-Itza is 
               considered one of the world's 7 wonders, and the 
               home of the ancient Maya civilization.
               Located in the main square, the main pyramid of 
                civilization is better known as "El castillo", 
                translated into English as "The castle". 
                This structure is 79 feet tall and has 4 sides 
                with 91 steps. Mysteriously, when the sum of all 
                the steps that the pyramid has is made, the result 
                is 365, which represents the days of the solar year.
                Additionally, as part of the architecture throughout
                the pyramid, you can see the design of a feathered 
                serpent descending the pyramid whose head ends at 
                ground level, with its tail at the height of the 
                main entrance of the temple, which is It is 
                strongly projected during the dates of the equinoxes.

                    There are two ranges of dates in this ancient civilization 
                    where during the dates (from March 19th and 
                    March 23rd), and (from September 21th and September 22nd) 
                    each spring and fall of the year respectively, the 
                    length of the day and night are exactly the same 
                    with respect to both hemispheres (northern and 
                    southern). In this event hundreds of 
                    tourists from all over the world visit the pyramid 
                    to witness how the sunlight diminishes to reflect 
                    the night shadow descending the pyramid's stairs. 
                    It is said that the ancestors of civilization and 
                    even tourists today can feel their grillwork being 
                    renewed when witnessing this scene.
