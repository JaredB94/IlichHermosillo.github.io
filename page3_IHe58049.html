            <p class="essay_Content">
                Within one of the most famous video games consoles 
                nowadays is the Xbox. Additionally, the newest 
                version of this console is the Xbox series X. The 
                number of titles that we can find nowadays for 
                X box series console is such high that the list 
                would be overwhelming even to read. Hence, the 
                following table displays only the top three 
                titles so far, including their current approximated 
                market prices. After that, I am sharing my opinion 
                about the world of gaming nowadays as well.

            <h2 class="essay_Title">Effect of videogames in people</h2>
            <p class="essay_Content">
                Technology is growing by leaps and bounds, 
                then, videogames are not the exception at 
                all. Every day more and more people are 
                getting involved in new experiences related 
                with technology by diverse reasons, 
                some people for money, some for simple 
                hobby and even for earnings by social media 
                and/or streaming on live. Furthermore, 
                streaming has become one of the most 
                popular entertainment media all around 
                the world in which gamers obtain even more 
                profits than in a professional job. 
            </p>

            <p class="essay_Content">
                However, people considered only viewers 
                spend most of their spare time just 
                supporting streamers, effect that has 
                caused resection of physical and professional
                performance in teens and young adult people.
                Video gaming is a good entertainment and 
                distress manner. However, it can become 
                dangerous for people with no strong mindset 
                for real life, almost comparable as drugs. 
                Videogames and streamers have caught such 
                high attention from viewers that they become 
                addicts to it. Since many years ago, gamers 
                and viewers addict pay more attention to 
                these devices than their own health, their 
                own family, and their own education and/or 
                jobs.
            </p>

            <p class="essay_Content">
                In addition, following the rhythm in which 
                streamers are growing in amount, in a very 
                near future there will be more streamers on 
                Earth than white-collar professional 
                workers, being of course the youth 
                generations the majority range age for these 
                activities. And what it is even more 
                surprising is that they will keep earning 
                more than older population who keeps 
                working at their offices during their 
                entire life. Nevertheless, the possible 
                consequences are not very clear yet; 
                there are a huge number of opinions and 
                theories about how the future will be in 
                a world even more surrounded by technology, 
                a future in which human beings will become 
                unsociable species only paying attention 
                to the screens in front of their eyes, just 
                like many movies have warned us.
